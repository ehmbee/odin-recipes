    <p>Egusi is a west African staple soup rich in fat, protein, and essential nutrients. 
        It is particularly common in Nigeria because of its delicious match with pounded yam. The melon seed, 
        which is the main ingredient, is derived from the melon plant in the same family as squash and gourds. The soup is
        usually served with pounded yam, fufu, or rice.</p>
